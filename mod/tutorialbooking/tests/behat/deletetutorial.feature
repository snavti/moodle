        When I log in as "teacher1"
        And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
        And "Tutorial booking to delete" activity should be visible
        And "Tutorial booking 2" activity should be visible
        And I delete "Tutorial booking to delete" activity
        Then "Tutorial booking 2" activity should be visible
        And I turn editing mode off
        And I should not see "Tutorial booking to delete"
