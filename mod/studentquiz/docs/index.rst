Moodle Plugin StudentQuiz
=========================

This documentation is meant for everyone interested in the usage, management, 
and development of the StudentQuiz Moodle Plugin.

------------
Introduction
------------
StudentQuiz is an optional plugin listed in the official Moodle Plugin Directory.
While Moodle's Quiz module allows teachers to define quizzes to be answered by
students with a variety of question types, StudentQuiz moves one step further allowing
students to contribute to the pool of questions related to the course.
StudentQuiz can be configured to award points for contribution and participation
by students and allows techers to moderate the question pool by approving or
deleting unsuitable or wrong question. StudentQuiz enables students to rate and
optionally comment the questions they answered, awarding the creator of the question
with additional points.

StudentQuiz provides comprehensive filters to let students focus on the questions,
they need to work the hardest on.
