  In order to reuse my studentquizzes
  As a admin
  I need to be able to restore the moodles backups from old studentquizzes, and the comment history feature work normally

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |

    And I press "Save changes"
    And I restore "backup-moodle311-c1-historycomment.mbz" backup into a new course using this options:
    And I am on the "StudentQuiz 1" "mod_studentquiz > View" page
    And I choose "Preview" action for "Example question of Student 1" in the question bank
