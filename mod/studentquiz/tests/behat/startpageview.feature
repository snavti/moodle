  @javascript
  Scenario: Check if the default filter settings are visible
    When I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "StudentQuiz 1"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    Then "Filter" "fieldset" should be visible
    # Unfortunately a field group has no correct target in the for, so we have to check the field differently
    #And "Fast filter for questions" "field" should be visible
    And "[for='fgroup_id_fastfilters']" "css_element" should exist
