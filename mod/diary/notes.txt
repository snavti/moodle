Diary is based on a highly modified version of the Journal plugin.
It allows a user to create a new entry each day. Each entry can be
individually graded, with results being shown based on the selected
aggregate type of rating.
Currently, the user can edit any entry, but cannot start a new
entry on a skipped day.

Sometime ago, due to a forum inquiry, I started to
modify a copy of journal and create a diary module.
Eventually, I removed it from all my Moodle sites,
but have decided to work on it some more.
07/26/2018 Verified I don't have diary installed anywhere.
07/26/2018 Installed diary code to moodle35.
07/26/2018 report.php modified line 136 that used to
be a notification entry, so that it is now:
    echo $OUTPUT->notification(get_string("feedbackupdated", "journal", "$count"), "notifysuccess");
07/26/2018 Added the missing comment lines from 2 thru 15.
07/26/2018 Went through all the SQL statemnts and made sure
that all the "j's" were changed to "d's" for consistency.
07/26/2018 Converted multiple double blank lines to single ones.
05/21/2019 Verified diary is still installed in moodle35.
05/21/2019 Installed a copy into my development site, moodle3dev.
05/23/2019 Modified view.php to force the edit menu cog to show.
05/24/2019 Added timecreated field and have it working along with
the timemodified field, I think.
05/24/2019 I think part of my problem starting a new entry,
might be due to calculations being made based on GMT.
05/26/2019 Set version to 0.8Beta.
05/27/2019 Fixed file handling error in view.php so that
now audio and video files will play.
06/03/2019 Added download and refresh toolbuttons to report.php.
Also started developing toolbar for each entry that allows
the teacher to go to previous and next days, if they exist.
06/04/2019 Got renderer.php working for the activity introduction.
I also moved the diary_print_user_entry and diary_print_feedback
functions to the renderer.php file.
06/05/2019 One step forward, then two steps back. Just not making
any progress. Every time I have tried something, there is always one
step that breaks the method I am trying. Cannot seem to get past
needing $this->, or needing $OUTPUT, to try and get the entry toolbar
to work.

Had to abandon adding another renderer. Had to abandon putting all
my new stuff in lib.php and moving it to locallib.php. In there I
had to abandon using private function and just make things as function.
Even some that are in there already, (Copied from hotquestion) will
have to have the public function changed to just function.

If that is the case, then why bother having locallib.php.
Just put everything into lib.php like I had.

Finally, something WORKED! In view.php, about line143, when getting
the user diary entries, I inserted a $sort = 'timecreated DESC' and
the users entries are now listed from newest, to the oldest!

Later, should see about making a switch so the user can select the
sort order. Also select month and year, maybe.

06/06/2019 Made a change to the day check for starting a new entry.
Now using diff function.
06/07/2019 Made a change to the day check for starting a new entry.
Instead of checking for ($diff->d > 0), which is only triggered at 24
hours, I am trying ($diff->d + $diff->h) > 0.
06/07/2019 Added a third, Save all my feedback, button to the top of
the users with an entry. Checked that all three buttons do work.
06/08/2019 changed back from using diff function to one that uses floor.
Also make it so there is a Save all my feedback at the top of the list,
below each entry, and at the bottom of the page.
Also played with the sort order of the report page, but never could get
the results I wanted. Reverted to old sort.

06/09/2019 Finally fixed edit.php so that when it is a new calendar
date, it will start a new entry, no matter how many hours have elapsed.
06/06/2019 Finally fixed the double button problem for the user entry
toolbar. Each button used $output and the function was also returning
a $output, which gave two sets of tools.
06/13/2019 Added another color setting so that the view.php has a color
for the whole background as well as another color for the text background.
I also added code in the report.php so that each entry uses one of the
two colors. Still deciding which one to use. For report, the code is
actually in lib.php, in the, function diary_print_user_entry, about line 948.

06/15/2019 Finally figured out a really simple way to get the entries list
on the report.php page to be in alphabetical order.
06/15/2019 Double whammy! Got the list order to work and just now, I also
have gotten the download_entries to work. Still have a few bugs to work
out due to $this-> not working. Later 1800 - I have the bugs fixed. Just
need to verify things tomorrow and do some code cleanup.

06/16/2019 Made a slight change to the ORDER BY in SQL for entries list
in report.php file. Added both u.lastname ASC and u.firstname ASC. Also
had to add $sort 'lastname ASC, firstname ASC' in report.php, at about
line 185, so that the list of users with no entry, is alphabetized, too. 
Started adding icons for previous and next toolbuttons. Also added css
style for the notice that an entry has changed since the last feedback
was made. It now shows slightly larger, red, and underlined so it stands out.

06/17/2019 Fixed css style for the notice that an entry has changed since the
last feedback was made for the view.php page. Also made it so the info is
posted below each entry on the page.

06/17/2019 Fixed backup and restore so they now work, correctly.

06/18/2018 Added red warnings for needs regrade and needs grading.

06/21/2019 Discovered was still using one Journal string in report.php
where the code for the, Save all my feedback, button was being assigned
to a variable. Fixed to use Diary string.

06/21/2019 Discovered the Recent Activity function was ORDER BY timemodified,
and since I had changed the report.php to use lastname, firstname in ASC
order, I changed the Recent Activity to also us alphabetical order.

06/22/2019 Added a couple of new student users, Moe Money and Allie Katt
so that I could make sure sort was working for both lastname and firstname.

06/23/2019 FINALLY! Got a toolbar working in report.php. Setup case switches
to change the $DB->get_records to sort various items and ways so that I
get the needed results. Each switch also refreshes the page and changes
the heading to tell which data is being displayed.

06/25/2019 Removed a LOT of leftover development code that is no longer
needed.

07/22/2019 Finally have "correct" edit capability. Pushed ver. 0.9.5.
07/25/2019 Pushed ver. 0.9.6 Have things to the point of REALLY needing to
start development for ratings.
08/03/2019 Have started adding code for ratingoptions as ver. 0.9.7
10/04/2019 Commented out line 53 of lib.php that is calling a function I
not implemented yet.

05/31/2020 Started transferring tickets from User Support Tracker into
Diary Support Tracker.

20200709 Diary_499, Need Entries per page selector for view.php page, is
    now Being tested.

20201003 Finally tracked the toolbar render problem to html_writer::alist.
   Changed to $output in both render.php and report.php.
20201004 Added a space between the group dropdown list and the Toolbar
    label on the report.php page.
20201004 Moved the heading info on view.php up five lines so the info is

20201004 Added, Editing period has ended message, that is shown when the
    activity is closed.
20201005 Added missing data to the backup and restore process.
20201006 Worked on backup restore some more.
20201008 Yesterday and today worked on the restore process. Tentatively,
    it now seems to be working correctly.
20201008 Five minutes after I wrote the last entry, I realized I was doing
    it wrong. Checked database backup steps, and sure enough, I am not
    backing up the ratings.
20201009 Finally got a backup to include ratings in the backup file. Now
    to work on the restore process.
20201010 Changed published tickets to closed.

20210426 Ran codechecker and got a bunch of print_error deprecated notices.
    Changed them all to something similar to this:
    throw new moodle_exception(get_string('incorrectmodule', 'diary')); 
20210426 Bumped version to 3.2.1 and published changes.
20210501 Started development of Diary v3.3.0, and started converting embedded
    styles over to classes. Mainly working in view.php so far.
20210510 Adding version check <311 to use grade string else gradenoun string.
20210511 Worked on CSS changes to view. report and reportsingle pages.
20210516 For the past few days I've been working on getting Diary ready
    for Moodle 3.11.
20210605 Not much time spent on Diary for a while due to medical reasons
    and working on other plugins. However, today I redid word count a little
    and also added a new character count. This required two new strings.
20210606 WOrked on word and character counts. At the last minute, I think
    I have a way of getting the desired results.
20210607 Have gotten the word and character counts to work for raw, clean,
    and standardized 5 character word counts. Pushed to github and
    created Diary v3.3.1.
20210608 Discovered two minor bugs. There are two sets of buttons at bottom
    of report when everyone has at least one entry, and String [grade,core]
    is deprecated.
20210609 Fixed the two sets of buttons problem. Pushed to github.
20210609 Fixed the grade string deprecated problem. Pushed to github.
20210611 Fixed deprecated item in lib.php.
20210612 Pushed current changes to github.
20210613 I think I have fixed github issue #9. Also added fix to prevent
    direct access to the edit.php page when the Diary is closed.
20210615 Worked on combining the code for, Details, in view.php, report.php,
    and reportsingle.php. The code for the latter two is actually in the
    results.php file. Also working on increasing the details to include
    other statistics.
20210619 Spent the past three days trying to fix the code for detecting
    a user attempt to cheat by changing the timecreated. Finally seem to
    have it working, but still need to decide what to do about the rating.
20210620 Added new strings. Clean up code and push to github for test release.
20210621 Made one more change that prevents failure when creating a new entry
    and settings are No and Yes.
20210622 Finished testing and released Diary v3.4.1.
20210622 Started work on adding more statistics with the eventual goal of
    automatic grading like the essayautograde quiz question.
20210626 Finally got the paragraph count to "look" right by changing the
    explode to let me check for multiple delimiters.
20210627 Worked more on paragraphs and now have it using my version
    of to_plain_text and standardize_white_space.
20210628 Converted all the stats over to using the same clean text I
    use for calculating paragraphs. Spent a bunch of time on textarea
    trying to come up with a workable auto-size for the width. Gave up.
    Think I'll just try to switch to using a texteditor. I also compared
    my stats results to the essay (autograde) stats and they match right
    down the line. When I compare to a couple of the online checkers,
    almost nothing seems to match. Of course, they require a fairly
    large, minimum number of words, I guess to make it "difficult"
    to prove their results are wrong.
20210629 Researched on adding new fields to the mdl_diary table for use
    with the new statistics.
20210702 Worked on getting the common errors statistic to work. I have
    gotten it to find errors, but not give the correct count just yet.
20210703 Got the Common errors count working correctly. Started adding
    new settings to the activity mod_form. Added nine new fields to the
    mdl_diary table.
20210706 Added strings to use in stats that had been created with hard
    coded text names.
20210706 Started adding help pop overs for some stats.
20210707 On the report and reportsingle pages, I have added the name
    of the teacher who lasted entered a rating/feedback for an entry
    to go along with their picture.
20210709 Yesterday and today worked on settings.php and mod_form.php pages.
20210710 Added automatic info (description) for item type and item count.
20210710 Added automatic info (description) for mins and maxes for
    characters and words.
20210710 Went back and added two more fields, itempercent and errorpercent.
20210711 Added strings and selector settings to mod_form for itempercent
    and errorpercent. Updated code to reflect rating instead of grade.
20210711 Fixed errors in various disabledif settings in the mod_form.php
    file caused by change from autograde to autorating.
20210711 Started work for showing penalty calculations.
20210711 Modified function get_common_errors($text, $diary) so that
    it now calculates errorpercent instead of just giving a 0.
20210711 Moved $itemtypes list from view.php to diarystats.php as a
    function so I can use the list in other places.
20210712 Worked on adding settings to the settings.php page. Moved
    some more functions from sttings.php and mod_form.php, into the
    diarystats.php so they can be used in multiple places without
    needing to be re-written.
20210713 Fine tuning settings and checking that the defaults set on
    this page, appear on the the mod_form.php page when starting to
    create a new Diary activity.
20210715 Added new stats: shortwords (one syllabel) and medium words
    (two syllabels) to go along with longwords (three or more syllables).
    Unique words = shortwords + mediumwords + longwords. Discovered
    error in count_syllables function.
20210718 Rewrote function codes so that count_syllables gets excecuted
    only once, instead of multiple times. Multiple executions were being
    caused by separate checks for one, two, and three or more syllable
    words, plus a separate total syllable check.
20210719 Added two new class files based off Dave Child code on github.
    Greatly improved syllable count accuracy. Files are pluralise.php
    and syllables.php.
20210814 Not able to work much over the past few days, but have added another
    field, enablestats. Lets me show stats without autorating.
20210818 Doing some code cleanup and finally published an ALPHA version.

20211229 I have done a LOT of development work over the past four months
    but have not been keeping this file up to date due to my wife and
    the last of four sisters have died. My wife due to pancreatic cancer
    and my sister due to COVID-19. At the request of Jason Press I have
    create a new admin capability to import entries from a Journal
    activity, and place them into a Diary activity. I have also cobbled
    together a bunch of statistics and a one of many items that can
    automatically generate an autorating. There is also a button that
    will add all this info to the feedback and rating of an entry.
    There is also a new button that will let you clear everything out
    of the feedback/rating area of an entry.
20210102 Fixed a bunch of minor bugs. See tickets for 350.17. Also did
    a lot of code cleanup. Bumped to stable version and pushed to git hub.
20220107 Over the past few days, I have fixed a bunch of minor bugs,
    consolidated some more duplicate code in report.php and reportsingle.php,
    and fixed a grade bug caused by the, Clear feedback, button. Pushed
    current changes to MOODLE_350.02_STABLE then started cleanup based
    on codechecker reports.
20220110 Spent the past couple of days working on cron_task.php and finally
    seem to have it working for M3.11. Need to check other versions.
20220115 Finally got a link to the new changes documentation for Moodle 4.0.
    It has instructions for the new icons and due to the way it is
    implemented, I will have to make a Diary release that will be for
    Moodle 4.0 only.
20220120 Spent the past two days running new codechecker and phpdoc check
    trying to make sure everything is ready for v3.5.0 release.
20220122 Spent the past couple of days working on always show description.
    Finally got it to work for M3.11 and below. Need to check in M4.0.
20220130 Released Diary 3.5.0 a few days ago. Dinis M. notified me of some
    string errors and possible code error. I have fixed the strings,
    modified the code a little and am pushing v3.5.0+ to github.
20220208 Had to change the code again for issue#16. Was checking while
    using hardcoded text, but have changed to strings.
20220212 Fixed two moodle.org code prechecks for externalbackup warnings.
