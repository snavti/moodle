    Added fields to the xml file. Updated the upgrade.php file. Updated backup files.
    Updated the mod_form.php file.
Diary_779 - Need to work on the help pop up windows for stats. Currently
    set this ticket status to waiting.

=== 3.6.0 === Pending

Diary_750 - V3.4.1 has three code style errors. Added the missing final blank line
    to files diarystats.php, renderer.php, and settings.php. Pushed to github.
    This ticket seems to be missing from my tracker system.

Diary_737 - Config settings are not all named the same. Added mod_ to the four
    items that were missing it. As of 20220828 still have three.

Diary_812 - Diary v4.0 changes for Moodle 4.0. Made a number of changes. See
    the ticket for details. Mostly was removing un-needed code.
Diary_823 - Missing completion information on the view.php page. Got
    it working on course page - BUT - the ticket is still open for further
    development to also require X number of Posts.
Diary_845 - Invalid get_string() identifier: 'lastedited' or component 'diary'.
    Changed diary/db/mobile.php lang string from ['lastedited', 'diary'], so
    that it is now ['lastedited', 'moodle'].
Diary_883 - In Moodle 4.0.x the activity name, description, and completion labels get
    duplicated. In view.php down around line 225, I added an if to check for an intro
    and branch, to decide whether to show the items, or not.
Diary_912 - When auto-rating is set for characters, it always reports zero. Basically,
    changed a number of places where it was trying to use 'chars', so that it was
    now using the full word, 'characters.' Also changed the final line of the
    auto-rating to show 0%, instead of a negative number.
Diary_913 - Need to change MOD_PURPOSE_COLLABORATION over to MOD_PURPOSE_ASSESSMENT.
    Made the needed change from, MOD_PURPOSE_COLLABORATION, over to, MOD_PURPOSE
    _ASSESSMENT. New color and new icon, look good. (See ticket Diary_914)

    Inkscape to modify the icon.svg file then saved as monolog.svg. Works great.

    character, words, sentences or paragraphs. Modified and added a couple of
    strings, and made a LOT of code changes and additions in the diarystat.php
    file.

    the needed changes in four places for each one and added the two need strings

Diary_815v - Issue#16 at github regarding hardcoded text.  20220208 Revisited
    issue#16 as the .01+ version introduced some hard coded text checking that
    needed to be changed to string checks so it would work with other languages.
Diary_818v - Moodle reports two warnings for backup. Upon close examination of
    the backup_diary_stepslib.php file, I found the errors. I changed multiple
    fieled names, in the install.xml file, but I missed changing two field names
    in the backup_diary_stepslib.php.
Diary_822v - When I run php adhoc_task.php --execute I get an Undefined property

    of text in the table. 20220208 Revisited issue#16
Diary_817v - Math code missing for Potential Common error penalty. Switch string
    to use multiple {$a}'s in strings and accidentally left off the math code
    for this answer. Added the math calculation back and verified it is working
    correctly.

=== 3.5.0 === Released 2022012200
Diary_514v - Sort order label needs css setting. Removed all the hard coded h5's.
    There were about 21 of them, 19 in view.php and two in the language file. 
    Added classes, one for the whole table and one for some table cells.
Diary_654v - There is a request for using Atto editor in report.php for feedback.
    Have added the Atto editor so it appears on both the report.php and
    reportsingle.php pages. Still need to add file handling.
Diary_707v - link to index.php page on report.php page should be on the same line
    as the toolbar. Made code changes as needed to move the link.
Diary_711v - File report.php has hard coded tags that should be removed. Removed
    them as part of my work in CSS changes. 20211201 Converted more hardcoded
    text to strings some of which were in diarystats.php.
Diary_722v - Should move toolbar to the right like I did on the report.php page.
    Moved toolbar to the right on view.php page.
Diary_730v - Need an enablestats setting. 20210812 Created the new setting
    along with new fields, selector, strings, and code as needed.
20210812 Tested and seems to be working.
Diary_732v - Missing the Diary icon on moodle.org. 20210815 This was Diary_765
    on moodle311. 20210815 Forget what day I did it, but I changed from svg file
    to gif and the icon now shows on moodle.org.
Diary_733v - See about moving functions from mod_form to diarystats. Was Diary_764
    which I have abandoned on moodle311. 20210712 Moved function get_item_types($itemtypes).
    20210712 Moved function get_rating_options($plugin). 20210712 Moved 
    get_showhide_options($plugin).
Diary_734v - Need to convert from lib.php cron function to /classes/task/cron_task.php.
    Added tasks.php file in db folder. Added task folder in classes folder. Added
    cron_task.php file in classes/task/. The file, cron_tasks.php, still needs
    some more work.
Diary_738v - Need activity color setting for entry's. Added new fields for the
    two colors in mdl_diary table. Made changes to the install.xml and upgrade.php
    to add two new fields, entrybgc and entrytextbgc. Updated the mod_form.php
    file to now have appearances settings for the two colors. Added code changes
    so the new settings are actually used. Added code changes to backup, which
    was tested and it worked as expected.
Diary_739v - Teacher's name is missing from reports. Added a new line break which
    moved Rating and Average of ratings down one line. Then added code to output
    the name of the last teacher to give feedback/rating. Seems to be working as
    expected.
Diary_740v - Need new DB fields for new statistics settings. Added nine new fields
    to the mdl_diary table. Have gone back and added more fields for added ratings.
Diary_742v - Need to pass diary->errorcmid to the get common errors function. Instead
    of just passing $text(cleaned plain text) and $errorcmid(actually $diary->errorcmid),
    I switched to passing $text and $diary. I found that I needed another item from
    $diary, so it is easiest just to use the whole $diary array.
Diary_743v - The mod_form.php needs updating for new settings. Added new settings
    and other bits of code as needed to implement the new settings. The list still
    needs work. It is not saving and restoring, yet.
Diary_744v - The settings.php needs updating for new settings. Added headings, strings,
    and settings as needed. Some future use code is no longer there, but a copy
    is in the beta and alpha code versions.

    created 20 stats and now need to thoroughly test them. Still in development!
    20210718 Rewrote count_syllables function and totalsyllables. 20210719 Added
    two new class files: pluralise.php and syllables.php that greatly improve
    the syllable count accuracy.
Diary_749v - Multiple errors when, Type of countable items, is None. Added a check
    to detect and prohibit when trying to autograde with None. 
Diary_767v - Need Journal to Diary entries migration tool - admin only! Got a
    version working with some error checking. 20211207 Added code, event string,
    and journal_to_diary_entries_transfer.php file to log transfer events. 20211208
    Made change to the diary id shown to reflect that of the destination diary
    instead of the diary the admin is in.
Diary_768v - Journal to Diary xfr needs to tag the feedback with info that it is
    a transfer entry. Created initial code version and it works as expected. Updated
    the code to fix error when the entry has no feedback in the journal as it is
    going to have some added during the transfer. 2021201 Changed code so that the
    inclusion of this is optional.
Diary_769v - Journal to Diary xfr breaks if there are no Journal activities in the course.
    This was fixed while working on other recent tickets -767, 768. Added a new string
    for this: $string['journalmissing'] = 'Currently, there are not any Journal
    activities in this course.';
Diary_770v - Add autorating buttons Note: report.php > results.php has hardcoded
    text on new buttons. - Fixed. Added code to create the two new buttons and they
    both reliably work on report.php page. STILL NEEDS WORK on the reportsingle.php
    page for the, Save all feedback and Add to feedback buttons!
    CODE IS IN results.php DOWN AROUND LINE NUMBER 420. 20220108 Fixed and only
    using the one, Save all feedback, button. Code for the, Add feedback, is there
    but commented out for later possible use.
Diary_771v - Need a title centered at the top of the xfr new menu item. I added
    an h3 with a style to center align the new heading. Used an existing string.
Diary_772v - The item being used in the auto-rating needs to detect when NOT short,
    or you have more than required. Changed the code and now getting expected
    results.
Diary_773v - Would be nice to include percentage to shortwords, mediumwords, and
    longwords. Added code to calculate the three percentages to two decimal places.
Diary_774v - Would be nice to include a statistic for Average Syllables per word.
    Added code and error prevention for divide by zero for cases where student
    did not submit any text, only some kind of file.
Diary_775v - Would be nice to include a statistic for Average word length in
    characters. Added code and error prevention for divide by zero for cases
    where student did not submit any text, only some kind of file.
Diary_776v - Need to check for and prevent divide by zero errors in the stats.
    Broke up the $currentstats variable build and added an if check for
    uniquewords before I started adding any stats. Added a string for,
    No text detected.
Diary_777 - FK Grade formula needs to include max. Changed formula to use
    max so that the FK Grade cannot go below zero.
Diary_778v - Need to remove hard coded text and change to strings in diarystats.php.
    Made changes as needed and converted some to use {$a} to help simplify the
    code.
Diary_780v - Need results displayed after doing a transfer. Added code in
    journaltodiaryxfr.php file down around line 284 that checks counters added
    around lines 34, 35, 97 and 161. Also added a string, xfrresults, for the output.
Diary_781v - Would be nice to fill the remaining statistics cell with Average words
    per paragraph. 20211208 Moved the last row, averages, of the statistics general
    table up one row so that Lexical density, FK Grade, Flesch reading ease and Fog
    index are in the last row of the table. I also added a new, Average words per
    paragraph, statistic in the last cell of the, averages, row.
Diary_782v - Reportsingle user page needs Save and stay here button. Changed the code
    for the, Add to feedback and Clear feedback buttons along with a few other items
    and now the Save all feedback button seems to work the way I want it to. 
Diary_783v - Code for, Save all my feedback, button in report.php and reportsingle.php
    needs cleanup. Eliminated all the escaped double quotes and changed them as
    needed to singles. Also moved duplicate code to a single function in results.php.

    days, I have worked on this and other related "undefined" variable errors and
    everything seems to be working now.
Diary_785v - Autorating calculations are incorrect. 20211229 Over the past few weeks
    I have worked on making sure the calculations are correct. Looks like they are
    now, no matter which Item I select for the autorating.
Diary_786v - View all course diaries, link is giving a debug warning. Got it fixed
    but I think I need to revert the sql part of the code as it started causing an
    undefined variable warning on the view.php page. Got that fixed, but in a way
    I really don't like as it requires reading the diary record for every diary
    in the course, whereas the original method only needs to read one file. I have
    added the action in report.php line 397, and index.php line 146.
Diary_787v - The, Save all my feedback, button on reportsingle.php page needs to
    stay on the page. The button now stays on reportsingle.php page. Changed
    form action from report.php to reportsingle.php.

    the code that generates the stats from results.php to file view.php, and
    stats table is now working again.
Diary_791v - Need to move function diary_count_entries($diary, $groupid = 0)
    from lib.php to results.php. 20211219 Copied the working function in the
    lib.php file and moved it to classes/local/result.php, making changes as
    needed to get it to work.
Diary_792v - Notice: Undefined variable: currentstats in  
    /var/www/moodle40/mod/diary/classes/local/diarystats.php on line 469.
    Moved the return $currentstats; and return, inside the if and else of the,
    function get_diary_stats($entry, $diary). 
Diary_793v - When looking at Complete Report you get:- Exception - Call to
    undefined function diary_format_entry_text(). Function was moved to
    results.php but the call was not modified to: 
Diary_795v - Automatically added Notes in the Description should only appear
    when editing/making new entry. This is now handled as a function call
    with the, public static function get_minmaxes($diary) { located in
    diarystats.php.
Diary_796v - enableautorating is not working correctly. This was actually
    being caused by two problems, one in the mod_form.php file and one
    in the diarystats.php file. See the ticket for details.

    code to add table definition and return $currentstats in diarystats.php
    file down around line 460.

    check. Added more log message details.

    Clear feedback, button is clicked. Added code to delete the correct
    rating table entry, then update the grade for the user.
Diary_806v - The code in cron_task.php, public function execute(), does not
    work correctly. Turned out that I only needed to add username to the
    requireduserfields list at about line 70. I also moved the list so I
    only had to create it once. I also tidied up the log messages, and added
    ones for older versions of Moodle.
Diary_810v - Need settings for alwaysshowdescription. Added new db field,
    alwaysshowdescription, added it to settings.php, added it to mod_form.php,
    added code for branch check on view.php, and added features,
    FEATURE_MOD_INTRO and FEATURE_SHOW_DESCRIPTION.
