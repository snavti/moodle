    points, not the negative scale id. Added new string, Final grade. Added code
    that gets the index of the highest item and entry, in the scale. Then adds
    both to the, Final grade, column heading. e.g. Final grade (6=Mastery), if
    using a scale of: No Credit, No Understanding, Beginning, Developing,

    Made changes to an if in renderer.php about line 356. See ticket for more details.
20220426 HotQuestion_846v - Are Completion & grades considered of interest? #53.
    Added modified code from contributed work into current Hot Question code. Then
    made a tone of updates and changes to get it working reliably.
20220427 HotQuestion_848v - String [grade,core] is deprecated. 20220427 Changed
    the language string reference in hotquestion/classes/output/viewgrades.php
    down around line 166 from, get_string('grade'), over to, get_string('gradenoun'),
    and the debug error went away.
20220427 HotQuestion_849v - get_extra_user_fields() is deprecated. Changed the code
    as needed to fix the problem. See the ticket for details.

    lib.php down around line 809.
20220427 Ran codechecker and fixed hundreds of warnings and errors, as needed.
20220502 HotQuestion_854v - Need a space between new Rating score and Rating ranking
    button. In view.php down around line 255, I added an echo space that only gets
    added if the user can see the button. For a normal student user, the extra space
    is not needed as spacing is handled by the toolbar.
20220503 HotQuestion_855v - Need heatgiven and heatreceived in place of Votes in
    Rating ranking. Added new $fields to the sql in ranking_tables.php file down
    around line 185 that counts the number of heat/votes that a user has received.
    Also added needed language string for heatreceived. Also changed the votes
    string to heatgiven.
20220504 HotQuestion_856v - Need teacherpriority column on Rating ranking page. Added
    the needed code to the ranking_table.php file like I did yesterday for heatreceived.
    Today, 20220507, I had to modify the sql to get it to show zero, positive, or
    negative teacher priority count.
20220505 HotQuestion_858v - Need to add percentage factors to column labels. Added
    needed info to the string for each column label. The way the ranking _table.php
    does this, it automatically gets added for downloads.
20220506 HotQuestion_859v - Need to change all references to rating over to grade. 
    Made code and language string changes as needed in the language file and other
    locations.
20220507 HotQuestion_860v - Need to change hard coded text to a language string in
    the /mod/hotquestion/classes/output/viewgrades.php file. Commented out the original
    line of code and changed to new version using a string. Have a second commented
    out version available, if needed.
20220507 HotQuestion_861v - The ranking_table.php file name needs to be changed to
    viewgrades.php. Changed the filename and, hopefully, all references to it in
    all the Hot Question files.
20220507 HotQuestion_862v - Need to change $rankingtable variable to $gradestable
    in grades.php file. Changed the $rankingtable variable to $gradestable. Hopefully,
    I have changed all references to it, also.
20220507 HotQuestion_863v - Need to fix viewgrades.php functions that print out the
    column data. Tested each of the column functions and fixed code and reference name
    errors, as needed. Ensured the teacher priority prints '-' in the teacher priority
    column for students that have NOT posted a question, yet. Prints a 0 if they posted
    a question, but the teacher has NOT changed the priority.
20220508 HotQuestion_857v - Need to redefine Hot Question DB fields size and defaults.
    Made changes as needed. See ticket for more details. 
20220508 HotQuestion_864v - Need to sort language file on string names. Completed
    manual sort using copy and paste.
20220508 HotQuestion_865v - Need to verify backup files are correct for all the new
    changes. Still needs further testing but backup and restore is working.
20220502 HotQuestion_839v - Need to make sure associated comments are deleted
    whenever a question is deleted. 20220510 1115 Added two lines of code and a comment
    to locallib.php. When a question is deleted, it, any comments on it, and any votes
    on it, are also deleted.
20220510 1130 Ran codechecker and made changes as needed.
20220515 HotQuestion_866v - Anonymous posts do not work. Fixed the anonymous problem by
    changing code in results.php down around line 408 by using isset check. 
20220519 1030 Hot Questions_868v - Group is not working correctly when going from view to
    grades. Noticed this problem back when I first integrated the contributed code. Just
    now spent a few minutes to actually add the $group information to the $url in
    view.php. Got a weird result (managers only) the very first time I went to grades.php
    page, but after that it seems to be working correctly.
20220608 HotQuestion_871v - Deleting a Hot Question activity does NOT delete associated
    grades. See ticket for details. Changed line 896 in lib.php and delete started working.
20220622 HotQuestion_873v - Default setting for Comments is not working on mod_form.php.
    Modified the 'default' on the mod_form.php page to use the current Hot Question
    configuration setting, that was missing and using a default of 0, which means, No. It
    is now giving expected results.
20220623 HotQuestion_874v - A question should not add to the grade if it is NOT approved.
     Added an if check in locallib.php function calculate_user_ratings that checks to see
     if the question is approved. Skips adding to the grade if not approved.
20220629 HotQuestion_875v - Changing the tpriority for a student does not update their grade.
    In the locallib.php file, I added a call to,
    $this->update_users_grades([$question->userid, $USER->id]); in the, public function
    tpriority_change($u, $question) {, which seems to fix the problem.
20220629 HotQuestion_876v - Changing the approval status for a sudent question does not
    update their grade. In the locallib.php file, I added a call to,
    $this->update_users_grades([$question->userid, $USER->id]); in the, public function
    approve_question($question) {, which seems to fix the problem.
20220630 HotQuestion_877v - When Whole Hot Question grading is NOT enabled, the View
    grades button should be hidden. Modified the if check in view.php, at about line
    264 so that the raw rating and view grades button are visible only if gading is setup.
20220706 HotQuestion_882v - In Moodle 4.0.x the activity name, description, and completion
    labels get duplicated. Added a branch check in view.php about line 233, that skips
    adding the intro for Moodle 4.0 and higher.
20220707 HotQuestion_887v - Anonymous post should NOT count towards a users grade. In file
    locallib.php at about line 855, I added, AND q.anonymous = 0. This is in the
    calculate_user_ratings function and makes it so that only entries that are NOT
    anonymous get counted towards a users grade.
