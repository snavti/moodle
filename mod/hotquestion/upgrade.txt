without any apparent problems. I also made a bunch of line length changes due to
codechecker recommendations. Made multiple entries to make sure I did not break something.
11/22/19 Added settings for Teacher Priority visibility and for Heat visibility. This
required some new language strings, two new fields in the mdl_hotquestion table,
and multiple lines of new code in renderer.php. It also required changes in the
install.xml file, the upgrade.php file, and the backup_hotquestion_stepslib.php file.
