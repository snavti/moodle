# Moodle Hot Question module
The first moodle activity for physical classroom. The idea comes from
Purdue University's hotseat.

Inside or outside classroom, students post questions into a Hot Question
activity from notebook, netbook, android, iPhone, iPod or any other device
which can access the moodle site. Students can also vote on others' 
questions, so that the hottest questions will be popped up to the top of
the list. Teachers can make oral comments on selected questions in classroom.

See the download page for more suggestions and way to use this plugin.

NOTE: If you plan on disciplinary action for any inappropriate question,
you should download the evidence BEFORE you remove questions or remove rounds, 
as once removed, questions and rounds are not recoverable.
